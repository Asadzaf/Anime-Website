  <h1> AnimeReview </h1>


<p> This website will be an assortment of my reviews on anime that I have watched. <br>
  The reviews will be completely biased, based on my opinion and my preferences. <br>
  Not all anime will be on here, only anime that I have watched, but to be fair I have watched a lot of anime.</p>
